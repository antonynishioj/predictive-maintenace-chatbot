Our problem statement is predictive maintenance using chat bot
The main program can be divided into two parts they are:
1. predicting error/issue in the machine and
2. getting notification/alert by chatbot and chatbot provides solution

# Predicting issue
This can be done by training an machine learning model by utilizing various inputs from sensors
for training chatbot nltk and tensorflow is used with training input/response as json file
alert is directly snd to the chatbot ui 
chatbot ui is done using html and css 
by runnong app.py chatbot can be accessed.

#Getting alert
for getting alert message to the user we have used twilio
which sends alert to the user phone in normal message application
which is convenient as other messaging platform uses internet for transmitting message but twilio doesn't require any internet it sends message through normal network.
